      <h1>Bach/Sleepout</h1>

      <p>
        My family owns a small bit of land over on
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks_Peninsula">Banks Peninsula</a>. We bought it
        about 10 years ago, and for quite some time just used it as a place to go camping over the
        summer. It's about a kilometre from the beach, and a short walk to the local shop &
        playground. About 5 years ago we decided it was time to put something more permanent on
        there. We already had a shed, which we stashed some of our camping gear in, but it was all
        still basically camping. So I drew up some rough plans on the computer, passed them around
        the various interested parties, and eventually we decided on a simple little sleep out that
        we could build.

      <h2>Plans</h2>

      The building is pretty straight forward - a single 6m x 4.2m room. French doors on one side, a
      single front door on another. A few windows. That's about it. The plans I drew up can be found
      <a href="/bach/plans.pdf">here</a>.

      <h2>Foundations</h2>
      Because the area is a flood zone we had to elevate the floor level. This means the house sits
      on roughly 1 metre tall pile foundations.

      <h2>Building</h2>
      We did all of the construction ourselves, apart from the electrical work.

      <h2>Deck</h2>
      Since this is a bach, it is basically only used during summer. So we had always intended to
      have a huge outdoor area. We've now added on a great big deck, with a small covered area. This
      is where we spend most of the time during the day, lounging on chairs on the deck, or eating
      our breakfast, lunch & dinner outside.
