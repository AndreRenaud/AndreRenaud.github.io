        Here we discuss getting the MangoPI MQ Dual to boot to a prompt in 1.5 seconds
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://mangopi.org/mangopi_mq">MangoPI MQ Dual</a> is a tiny board based
        around the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/T113-s3">AllWinner T113-S3</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        This is an interesting processor because of its cost
        <a
          href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Microcontrollers-MCU-MPU-SOC_Allwinner-Tech-T113-S3_C5197687.html"
          >(less than $5 USD in medium quantities at time of writing)</a
        >, integrated memory (128MB), and relatively full Linux support.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of the 'small' nature of this CPU, it lends itself to more deeply embedded projects.
        However, when used in this manner the relatively 'heavy' nature of Linux can become an
        issue, as it has impacts on build sizes, boot time etc...
      </p>

      <p>
        In the instructions below we're building a completely open source system from a combination
        of U-Boot, Linux kernel & Buildroot. This is all based on mainline upstream sources, which
        gives a huge amount of assurance about on-going support and the quality of development. The
        configuration of these pieces has been adjusted to minimise size (and functionality to some
        degree as a consequence) to demonstrate a plausible minimal Linux system as a starting point
        for building something. The focus is on boot speed.
      </p>

      <h3>Timing breakdown</h3>
      <p>The unit boots in the following rough phases/durations:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>250ms: Loading U-Boot from the SD card, initialising DDR, running U-Boot</li>
        <li>
          600ms: Loading Linux and root filesystem from the SD card and starting the Linux kernel
        </li>
        <li>
          400ms: Linux kernel initialising all drivers and mounting the initramfs root filesystem
        </li>
        <li>200ms: Userspace execution</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The biggest aspects of this are really reading content from the SD card. Unfortunately the
        U-Boot driver for the SunXI MMC device inside the AllWinner T113-S3 does not give us great
        performance. We are currently seeing ~6MiB per second, on a card that should be capable of
        many times that. If further improvements were needed, this would be the area to optimise.
      </p>

      <h2>Boot speed tips & tricks</h2>
      <p>
        There isn't anything particularly special about the image that is constructed here - the
        fundamental C source code has not been change in any way. What we have done is tweak the
        configurations in such a way to remove features we don't want, and adjust some default
        values. Here are the main areas that have been adjusted:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Baudrates</dt>
        <dd>
          Embedded Linux systems typically use a serial port as their primary console for
          development. This is normally not exposed on the final product. For various historic
          reasons, the default for this is set to 115200 baud. This is horribly slow. Modern systems
          have no problems with much higher baudrates on UARTs, some up to 12 Megabaud. For our
          purposes, 1.5 Megabaud is a good balance between speed, compatibility and standardisation.
          <aside>
            The reason for 115200 is that the 16550 (still the most common UART peripheral around)
            has a default clock of 1.8432 MHz. The smallest divider of this is 16 (for
            oversampling), which results in (1.8432/16) = 0.1152. This is 0.1152 MHz/edge == 115200
            baud.
          </aside>

          <p>
            We also add the <code>quiet</code> parameter to the Linux kernel
            <code>bootargs</code> to reduce its console output during boot. See
            <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Silent_boot">ArchLinux wiki</a> for more
            details. Full kernel logs are still available via <code>dmesg</code> if required
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Configuration</dt>
        <dd>
          U-Boot by default uses a 3 second boot delay to give you the opportunity to stop it at the
          prompt to run adhoc boot commands. While retaining the ability to do this is helpful,
          there is no need to have a delay at all. U-Boot will look for characters sent in the time
          between power on and the completion of the board initialisation. Any character sent then
          will interrupt the default boot if the boot delay value is set to 0. On the Mango Pi MQ
          this still gives us a few hundred milliseconds, which is sufficient.
          <p>
            This has been adjusted by setting <code>CONFIG_BOOTDELAY=0</code> in the U-Boot
            configuration.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Storage access</dt>
        <dd>
          This covers two things - don't hit the storage more frequently than you need, and don't
          store more than you need. To avoid hitting the storage too frequently we have dropped the
          U-Boot programmable environment. So you cannot make non-volatile changes to U-Boot without
          rebuilding U-Boot itself. This can actually be a benefit to reliability on embedded
          systems as any issues in the U-Boot environment can render the unit unbootable. So
          removing the ability to change it reduces some risk. It also means we don't have to look
          to storage to find a U-Boot environment file.
          <p>
            We have combined the kernel, device tree and filesystem into a single image which is
            loaded into memory in a continuous read.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have reduced the functionality in the filesystem & kernel to the bare minimum, thus
            reducing image size (3.5MB at this stage).
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>Reduced functionality</dt>
        <dd>
          We have removed as much as possible from the Linux kernel & Buildroot filesystem to bring
          the image size down.

          <p>
            In Buildroot we are using a statically built
            <a href="https://www.musl-libc.org">musl</a> based busybox executable. This removes the
            need for <code>libc.so</code>, by integrating it with busybox. However if more binaries
            are added, this would get duplicated, eventually no longer being worth while.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Linux we have turned off module support, and removed various subsystems that we're
            not using (wifi, sound etc...)
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h3>Other options</h3>
      <p>
        If the non-volatile root filesystem makes development awkward, moving over the using the
        EXT4 partition directly would be an option. This could also have some benefits to boot speed
        as only the needed files would be accessed during boot.
      </p>

        <summary>Timed Boot Log</summary>
        This boot log is obtained by monitoring the hardware serial port of the Mango Pi on P8. As
        we need the Linux kernel to initialise the USB peripheral, we cannot get the full boot
        console over the USB port. This bootlog is generated using
        <a href="https://github.com/tbird20d/grabserial">GrabSerial</a>. The first two column shows
        the absolute time from boot at which the line of text started. The second column shows the
        delta from the previous line. All values are in floating point seconds.

        <h4>RamSMP</h4>
        Note: These tests take quite a while to run. Also, due to the limited RAM available on this
        cpu, the kernel out-of-memory (OOM) killer will kill off these tests if run at full memory
        usage. So we have shrunk the usage a bit in some tests.
